Gumtree messages have not been coming through.Great 4WD for family fun. It's in good condition and one of the best value common rail Patrol's on the market.This is the DX, so no posh carpets or power windows here. Great for when the kids bring half the beach into the back seats, or the camping gear is muddy after a wet night, simply sweep off the vinyl floors and you're done.It's got a 2-inch lift (Tough Dog shocks & springs) with 35 inch tyres (Mickey Thompson MT). The Full length roof rack can carry heaps.The Factory bull bar has Spot Lights of course, and there's a light bar temporarily mounted at the rear (but not connected). Also at the back is a Rear Bar with dual tyre holders (takes weight off the door), and a Factory Towbar (2500kg rated).Inside there's a CB Radio, and a Roll Bar, along with the cloth seats (and vinyl floor!).It's got a New Battery, and a Battery isolation Switch, Snorkel, Tinted Windows and the traditional Kings awning.For that authentic GU Patrol experience, comes complete with a Bubble Dash (common problem with this model year), but it's mostly covered with a dash mat.There's a small chip in windscreen and rubber pulled out in one corner (not leaking), and finally the Brake Rotors need machining.$17,500 or VERY Near Offer.Reluctant Sale.

 An Excellently presented Prado GXL that has clearly been well appreciated. The Service history and general presentation is excellent, clearly this vehicle has never been used to frequent shopping centers etc and has lived in a garage predominantly as it is in outstanding condition for its age. Any serious buyers inspection is encouraged as this one wont last long. Think twice & you will likely miss out here.Viewing is by appointment so get in touch on ******0618 to make a time to view that suits you.

This has NO effect on the clutch what so ever it still engages and disengages as it should it’s just a bit noisy. If the Ute gets no interest within a week I’ll look at fixing it myself.There’s plenty I’ve missed. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have I’ll be happy to answer them.I’ll post more photos today once I’m finished cleaning it","Up for sale is my 1998 Ln167 single cab hilux.I’ve had this Ute for years and it’s been an absolute dream to drive taking me on many long tripsWithin the last few months I’ve completely rebuilt the engine with intentions of throwing a turbo on but my plans have since changed.Top and bottom end completely overhauled including new pistons, all new bearings and everything balanced, all new injectors, a reconditioned boost compensated fuel pump ($2,100), new genuine timing belt kit including new water pump, full genuine gasket kit used new radiator, new exedy safari clutch, new alternator, new exhaust system and I’ve replace a few other small bits and pieces during the build.Arb winch barUHFUpgraded head unit and speakers with long range aerialSeat coversSet up for dual batteriesWithin the last week I’ve been on multiple long trips during 40 degree days and the Ute shows no sign of over heating and will sit on 110kph all day.Since being back from my trip this week I’ve noticed the rear main seal has been leaking, bad enough to make the clutch start to vibrate slightly.

New hood, new seats and I’ve just fitted a new battery. You can tell it’s been loved (the paintwork is simply stunning!) If you’re after an MX5 to cherish and be proud of and in arguably the best colour combination and condition, then this is it. It’s the 6 speed, 1.8 twin cam EFI model and it looks, sounds and drives like a 2 year old. It’s never been modified and it even has the original stereo and electric aerial! I bought it off the original owner of 19 years for my son, he loves it but he’s just too big for it (6’7”). These cars are now classics and are rising in value. I’m not desperate to sell because it’s such fun to drive, so please don’t make lowball offers. Reasonable offers will however be considered. Come and have a look, you really won’t be disappointed! It will put the biggest smile on your face!!!","This is genuinely one of the nicest examples you will ever find. New hood, new seats and I’ve just fitted a new battery.

I have had Land Rovers continuously since 1976 and purchased this one brand new from Babagellos in Perth late 1996. From purchase this has always been the second vehicle in the family and specifically used for camping and adventures while living in the Kimberley/ Pilbara and Midwest/Gascoyne Regions of WA. Since relocating to Perth where I have had other work roles, she has done very few km. The economical diesel engine is described by my servicers as hardly broken in and runs to perfection. The turbo gives it an amazing capacity given only 4 cylinders and it's a Light Truck. Mechanically she is very sound and has always, and is still serviced by Land Rover Specialists. Because it has done so few km only a new H/D clutch has been fitted -all else is original. Next routine service is due at 61,000km. This girl was used for what it was designed for - 4x4 traversing and exploring in remote locations. It's gearing in low ratio is still second to none and it holds the best approach incline angle and side tilt angles in its class.Even though housed in a garrage 90% of the time, there are things needing to be done. She has a dented right rear fender caused when the L/R slid back on a gradient climbing out of a soft sand river bed (Driver error!). As this is the commonest damage locale on Land Rovers, I chose not to fix - always likely again. Although still working, time has made the light switch lever and wiper blade control brittle and the mechanisms broke. It rains so infrequently it just wasnt an issue for me - parts are readily available. Despite polishing her annually, rust on a few locations on the steel trim (NOT the body) see paint flaking.This year I replaced the steel wheels with alumiinium for their added lightness and good looks - however the 5 steel orignals come with it. It has a duel battery system with 1 being a deep cycle for fridge or accessories but also emergency start up. The cranking battery is almost new. The LR has a H/D tow ball for high or low mount. It has a fitted snorkal for water crossings and a cabin ceiling mounted storage cabinet, installed for $750 which also holds the UHF radio. There is a cargo cage between rear storage and middle seats. Body protectors have been fitted over each wheel arch. All seating is original.In doing due diligence, discussing with LR dealers and 4 x 4 clubs, based on near vintage status, extreme low km on the motor, and production of Defencders ceased in 2016, I have discounted the price to factor in panel repair and parts a LR enthusiast or collector would undertake. As I didn't think I would ever want to sell her, I renewed the licence for 12 months in July.Included on the LANDROVER are the following accessories with their original cost:1. Extra H/D Steel Bull Bar (not a small scrub bar) for Land Rover $1,7002. Low profile aluminium roof rack with ladder at rear of LRand fitted rollers for sliding up 2 long kayaks or other items $1,8003. Spot light and Flood light mounted to Roof Rack at cabin $ 3004. Full length H/D aluminium side steps $1,2005. Fitted GME UHF CB radio with cable to antena on roof rack (2008) $ 3506.

The previous owner was Les Hiddens (The Bush Tucker Man). I have owned the car for the last 60,000kms.I changed the oil and filters every 10,000kms and do both diffs as well. Gear box and transfer case were done at 40,000km intervals. Coolant was changed at 40,000, when I did the intercooler. Car has been well maintained, with no leaks.Car has been setup for long distant touring.Engine1.	Bell Auto Service (BAS) 170 HP tune. Being 170BHP and 450NM torque. This remap also shut off the EGR valve (It is done via software programming).2.	BAS uprated intercoolerhttps://bellautoservices.co.uk/store/b-a-s-hi-flow-defender-performance-intercooler/3.	BAS heavy duty silicon intercooler hoses4.	Provent catch can5.	Moonlight fabrications custom airbox and 5 inch stainless snorkel. This provides a sealed unit, that no longer runs right past the turbo. I believe this did give me a performance uptick. Designed to use the standard LR air filter.6.	Alisport full stainless exhaust system. Decat pipe, sports center muffler.7.	https://www.allisport.com/shop/performance-products/exhaust-components/defender-puma-2-2-tdci-110-full-exhaust/ (cat shell and center silencer)8.

Heavy duty clutch and new slave cylinder were installed at the same time and LOF clutch pedal spring upgrade (to lighten the pedal).3.	I had the transfer case shimmed at the same time the output shaft was done. This has removed 95% of the defender drive train backlash.4.	Syncro gears quick shifter – which makes it drive like a race car now.5.	Ashcroft ATBs installed in front and rear diffs.https://www.lrparts.net/da9011-automatic-torque-biasing-limited-slip-differential-by-ashcroft-transmission-for-defender-discovery-1-2-range-rover-classic.html6.

I have installed the full airbag man front and rear air suspension kits. I have the controller blocks mounted under the drivers seat. Gauges and switches to inflate/deflate each corner are in the console. ARB air compressor under the seat is used for this. Currently sitting on about a 30-40mm lift.This kit gives you the ability to inflate pressure in the bags as needed. Generally, I only touch the rear when I am loaded or have the camper trailer attached.2.	Superior Engineering castor corrected heavy duty front control arms3.
